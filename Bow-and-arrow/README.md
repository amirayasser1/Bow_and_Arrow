## About The Game :

Welcome to the Bow and Arrow Game. In this game, you'll step into the shoes of an archer with
the mission to pop colorful balloons using your bow and arrow. Are you up for the
challenge?

Here's a summary of what we implemented in this game.

1. Game Structure and Flow:
    - The game is structured using multiple classes to handle different aspects such as player control, balloon behavior, scoring, and UI elements.
    - It follows a clear flow, starting with a main menu where players can choose to start the game or access instructions.
2. Main Menu and UI:
    - The main menu presents options for starting the game and accessing instructions on how to play.
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%20fac1aab05d314e2a9f0d04b17dc9b392/Untitled.png)
    
    - UI elements, such as buttons for navigation, are implemented using the Button class.
3. Instructions and How to Play:
    - Players can access detailed instructions explaining the game controls and mechanics.
    - Instructions cover player movement, aiming, shooting, and managing ammunition effectively.
4. Level Selection:
    - Players can select different levels to test their skills.
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%20fac1aab05d314e2a9f0d04b17dc9b392/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - Level selection is presented as buttons on the main menu, providing a seamless transition between levels.
5. Game Levels:
    - The game features multiple levels, each with its challenges and objectives.
    - Level 1 introduces players to the gameplay mechanics, requiring them to pop balloons within a time limit.

    - Level 2, unlocked upon completing Level 1, offers increased difficulty with faster-moving balloons and additional obstacles.

6. Player Control and Interaction:
    - Players control an archer character using the mouse to aim vertically and shoot arrows.
    - Left-clicking fires arrows towards balloons, while right-clicking reloads arrows for continuous action.
    - The Player class handles player movement, aiming, shooting, and arrow management.
7. Balloon Behavior:
    - Balloons move dynamically across the screen, challenging players to adjust their aim and timing.
    - Balloons come in different colors, each representing a different level of difficulty.
    - The Balloon class manages balloon generation, movement, and collision detection with arrows.

8. Scoring System:
    - A scoring system tracks players' performance based on accuracy and efficiency in popping balloons.
    - Players earn points for each balloon popped, with bonus points awarded for completing levels and achieving high scores.
    - The Score class handles scoring logic, including checking for arrow-balloon collisions and updating the total score.
9. Audiovisual Experience:
    - Vibrant graphics and engaging sound effects enhance the gaming experience.
    - Visual elements include colorful balloons, player character sprites, and UI components.
    - Sound effects accompany actions such as firing arrows, popping balloons, and completing levels, adding immersion to the gameplay.
10. Game Over and Victory Conditions:
    - The game ends when players run out of arrows or complete all objectives in a level.

    - Upon completing a level, players receive a congratulatory message, their score is displayed, and they can proceed to the next level or return to the main menu.

#  Members Responsibilities :
After a meeting with brainstorming of how the game will go. At first, we draw our imagination to the game and how it will look like and create the UML Diagram, assigning ourselves to take tasks.
 All members helped each other after Mo'men had created the game frame and its UI that goes from one window to another and explained how the game would go through.
 Youssef and Amira then did the balloons with their HitBox and effects for interactions with the arrows.
Aya and Mona created then the character and arrow  with its interactions so it would pop the balloons.

Combining these codes, we have this game.

We faced some problems such as:
1. dealing with such a huge amount of lines of code and trying to handle it by applying the OOP concepts.
2. the first time we dealt with processing we treated it like a new programming language based on Java but with more methods. so we wanted some time to learn about it.
3. we didn't know about git and GitHub as a platform  that we could collaborate on so we tried to learn about some commands so we could work as a team
4. We had problems with the interactions with the arrow and balloons. we got inspired by other games so we could solve it i.e (Minecraft)
